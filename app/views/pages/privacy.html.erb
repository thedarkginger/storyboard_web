<h2>December 2018 Update:</h2>

<p> In our next version of the app, users will no longer purchase access to content behind the paywall. As a result, we are working with Apple to stop all active subscriptions so you will not be charged again. 

For your knowledge, there will be no more content distributed in this way through the app, beginning with our last post on December 15th. Thank you for your support.</p>
